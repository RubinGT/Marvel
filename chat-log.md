**User Request:** Make it GitHub compatible Error: "next start" does not work with "output: export" configuration. Use "npx serve@latest out" instead.
**Response Summary:** Configured the Marvel Rivals randomizer application for GitHub Pages deployment. Updated Next.js configuration to enable static export with proper output settings, modified package.json scripts to use serve command instead of next start, and successfully tested the build process. The application now generates a static `out/` directory that is fully compatible with GitHub Pages hosting. Updated documentation with deployment instructions.
**Files Modified:** 
- next.config.js (added static export configuration)
- package.json (updated start script to use serve command)
- README.md (added GitHub Pages deployment section)
